# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction

## Project Overview
Developed an end-to-end AQI prediction system using large-scale European environmental data to analyze air quality patterns and predict AQI levels.

## Data Description
- 357,000+ European air quality records
- Environmental and geospatial features

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Machine Learning (Random Forest)
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

## Key Work Done
- Cleaned and preprocessed large datasets
- Performed feature engineering and geospatial enrichment
- Trained Random Forest regression models
- Evaluated model performance (R² ~ 69%)

## Key Outcomes
- Built a reliable AQI prediction model
- Identified major contributors to air pollution levels
- Generated insights useful for environmental monitoring
